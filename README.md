## Project

### 2024 REU
- [AI Incidents and their Impacts](https://github.com/schmidtfrank/AI-Incident-Research): In this project, I collaborated with professors and peers on a data analysis project on AI incidents, utilizing machine learning and NLP to classify AI incidents with an accuracy rate of 95%.
  - [Final Poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C5ZSwyA3OtkQiUACJ0bklYfywTTckc8c/view?pli=1)
  - Framework: R, Python, Tableau, ARIMA, NLP, Naive Bayes Classifiers

### Wine Quality
- [Wine Quality Predictions](https://github.com/dyang0910/Wine-Quality-Prediction): Build regression and classification models that accurately predict the sensory quality score and to evaluate the performance of different ML techniques.
  - [Final Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1q9vkfAoFUbGqNIYz1vkdpG2CViPg337FwgvHLh9xOB4/edit?tab=t.0)
  - Framework: R, Regression Models, Classification Models

### Birdcall (ongoing)
- [Birdcall Classifications](https://github.com/dyang0910/Birdcall-Classifications): A hybrid machine learning and deep learning project that classifies corn bunting birdcalls using spectrograms, comparing feature-based models (like Random Forest) and CNNs, with visualizations to support biodiversity and ecological monitoring.
  - Framework: Python, Classical ML Models, Deep Learning Models, Web Scraping, Forecasting

### Automatic Detection of Bowhead Whales (ongoing)
- Train a custom BirdNET transfer learning model to recognize bowhead whale simple calls.
  - Framework: Python, BirdNET, Raven Pro, CNN.
